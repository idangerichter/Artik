Convention
==========

The following convention document in inspired by [google c++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Clang Foramt
* For most the conventions (apart from naming convention), we use clang format as an automatic tool to enforce code style consistency. Before every merge to master, format.sh should be called on the code base.

## Naming convention 
* Avoid abbreviation
* Variable names - snake_case
* Function names - PascalCase
* Class names - PascalCase
